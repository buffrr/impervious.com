        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        <h5>Last modified November 12, 2021</h5>
        <div style="text-align: left;margin-top:2em">
            <p>This Privacy Policy (<strong>“Privacy Policy”</strong>) outlines the information that Impervious gathers,
                how we use that information, and the options you have to access, correct, or delete such information
                when you use the Impervious Application(s) (<strong>“Application”</strong>). As used in this Privacy
                Policy, “Impervious,” “Us” or “We” refers to Impervious, Inc. and its affiliates. </p>

            <h4>1. Scope of Policy</h4>
            <p>We respect the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this
                privacy policy. This privacy policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that
                you may provide when you access or use the Application and our practices for collecting, using,
                maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.</p>

            <p>This Policy only applies to Impervious’ collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in
                connection with the use of the Application.</p>
            <p>This privacy policy does not apply to information you provide to or is collected by any third party
                whether through or in connection with your use of the Application or otherwise, including through any
                third-party application or content that may link to or be accessible from or on the Application. You
                agree and acknowledge that Impervious has no duty or responsibility to maintain and safeguard any
                information you may provide to, or is collected by, any third party whether through or in connection
                with your use of the Application or otherwise.
            </p>


            <h4>2. Information We Collect</h4>
            <p>We only collect and store the minimum amount of data we believe is required to operate and improve the
                Application. We do not collect or store personal information through your download and use of the
                Application. </p>
            <p>When you download the Application, we do not collect your name, phone number, or credit card information
                (or records of any payments collected by the applicable App Store, if any.) We do not receive from the
                App Store any of your personal data or other information about your App Store account. </p>
            <p>We do not ask you to create an account in order to use the Application. We only receive your email
                address if you have decided to give us feedback, request technical support and/or report bugs.</p>
            <p>When you use the Application, there are two categories of data that we collect: Operational Data and DNS
                Resolver Information as described more fully below.</p>

            <h4>2.1 Operational Data</h4>

            <p>We collect and store Operational Data when you use the Application. This data is used to operate our
                services and improve our Application for users everywhere. </p>
            <p>Types of Operational Data we collect and why:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device Data.</strong> We use information regarding your device, such as device model and
                    operating system, for troubleshooting and to improve our Application. This data does not include
                    unique device identifiers.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Crash Logs.</strong> We use crash log information regarding your device’s use of the
                    Application for troubleshooting and to improve our Application. Crash logs do not contain your IP
                    addresses or other personal information.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Feedback/Bug Reports.</strong> We require your email address if you choose to provide
                    feedback and bug reports. When you provide feedback, you can choose whether to share your console
                    logs. Console logs can include your device name and IP address. We use this information for
                    troubleshooting and to improve our Application. Your email address will be deleted 6 months from the
                    date of collection.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2.2. DNS Resolver Information</h4>
            <p>We collect limited DNS query data that is sent to the Impervious Public DNS resolver when you have the
                Application enabled on your device. The DNS resolver will identify your IP address only to allow you to
                access a website or other web resources. When answering a DNS query, the server discards all request and
                response data, including IP address, immediately after sending back the response to you. We do not store
                or retain this information.</p>

            <h4>3. How We Use the Information We Collect</h4>
            <p>Impervious does not collect or process personal information. We will not combine the information
                collected Operational Data with any other Impervious or third-party data in any way that can be used to
                identify individual end users and we do not store or retain DNS query data.</p>
            <p>We do not share the information with third parties otherwise as stated in this Privacy Policy and we
                never sell the information. </p>
            <p>We use the information we collect, as described in Section 2 to operate and improve the Application, such
                as to assist us in our debugging efforts if an issue arises. We may also use the information we collect
                to comply with legal obligations. We may share the information with our contractors, service providers
                and other third parties we use to support our business and who are bound by contractual obligations to
                keep information, whether personal or otherwise, confidential and use it only for the purposes for which
                we disclose it to them. In the event in the event of a merger, sale, change in control, or
                reorganization of all or part of our business, we may share this information with a buyer or other
                successor. </p>

            <h4>4. Data Security, Data Integrity and Access</h4>
            <p>We take all commercially reasonable steps to protect information we receive from you from loss, misuse or
                unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and/or destruction. We have put in place appropriate
                physical, technical, and administrative measures to safeguard and secure your information.
                Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we do
                our best to protect your information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted
                through the Services. Any transmission of information is at your own risk. </p>

            <h4>5. International Information Transfers</h4>
            <p>Impervious is a U.S.-based company. We primarily store your information in the United States. To
                facilitate our operations, we may transfer and access such information from around the world. If you are
                accessing or using our Application, you are agreeing to the transfer of your limited personal
                information described in Section 2 of this Application Privacy Policy to the United States and other
                jurisdictions.</p>

            <h4>6. Data Subject Rights and Choices</h4>
            <p>In the event you elect to contact us to report an issue with the Application, to share feedback, we may
                receive limited personal data about you, such as your email address, that we retain for a limited period
                of time. You will have the right to access, correct, update, export, or delete your limited personal
                information that we retain. You may email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@impervious.com">privacy@impervious.com</a>
                with any such subject access requests (<strong>“SAR”</strong>), and we will respond within thirty (30)
                days.</p>
            <p>Please keep in mind that except for when you provide feedback, we don’t receive personally identifiable
                information from you, and we are unable to associate your identity with your Operational Data or DNS
                Resolver Information. As a result, our ability to comply with data subject rights is limited to those
                circumstances in which we have your personally identifiable data.</p>

            <h4>7. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h4>
            <p>Any changes we make to our privacy policy will be posted here. If we make material changes to how we
                treat our users’ information, whether personal or not, we will notify you with a notice through the
                Application and/or by any other reasonable means. The date the privacy policy was last modified is
                identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for regularly visiting this privacy policy to
                check for any changes.</p>
