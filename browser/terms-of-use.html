            <p>The Impervious Application (“Impervious” or “Application”) is free and open source software and we stand
                by our commitment to help bring freedom to the internet.</p>

                welcome to modify the source code of Impervious as you want to meet your needs. The Mozilla Public
                License also gives you the right to distribute your modified versions.</p>

            <p>Please read the Terms carefully because they contain provisions that affect your rights and obligations.
                If you do not want to agree to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the
                Application.</p>

                    Impervious at its discretion.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Proprietary Rights</strong>. You are welcome to use the Application and we grant you its
                    rights to do so. Impervious, Inc. and its licensors reserve all other rights in the Application.
                    These terms are not intended to limit any rights granted under open source licenses applicable to
                    Impervious and to corresponding source code versions of Impervious. You are not granted any
                    trademark rights or licenses to the trademarks of the Impervious, Inc. or any party, including
                    without limitation the Impervious name or logo.

                <li><strong>Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties</strong>. THE APPLICATION AND ANY ASSOCIATED
                    CONTENT ARE PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS, WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND,

                    ASSOCIATED WITH US REPRESENTS OR WARRANTS THAT THE APPLICATION OR ANY ASSOCIATED CONTENT WILL BE
                    ACCURATE, RELIABLE, ERROR-FREE, UPDATED OR UNINTERRUPTED, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, THAT THE
                    APPLICATION ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS OR THAT THE APPLICATION WILL OTHERWISE
                    MEET YOUR NEEDS OR EXPECTATIONS.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>. YOUR USE OF THE APPLICATION AND ALL PRODUCTS AND
                        SERVICES DELIVERED TO YOU THROUGH THE APPLICATION AND ANY CONTENT ON THE APPLICATION IS AT YOUR
                        SOLE RISK AND DISCRETION. You may not assert claims for money damages arising from the
                        Application or any associated content against us, our affiliates, licensors or service
                        providers, or our respective employees, contractors, officers, directors and agents. We, our
                        affiliates, licensors and service providers, and our respective employees, contractors,
                        officers, directors and agents shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, special,
                        incidental, consequential or punitive damages, including but not limited to personal injury,
                        pain and suffering, emotional distress, or loss of revenue, profits, goodwill or data, whether
                        caused by tort (including negligence), breach of contract or otherwise, even if we knew or
                        should have known of the possibility of such damages, arising out of or in connection with (i)
                        your use, or inability to use, the Application, any associated content, or any products and/or
                        services delivered to you through the Service, (ii) any interaction with any third party,
                        including but not limited to Qualifying Businesses, through or in connection with the
                        Application, including other users, (iii) any information offered or provided within or through
                        the Application, or (iv) any other matter relating to the Application. </p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall we, our affiliates, licensors or service
                        providers, or our respective employees, contractors, officers, directors and agents be liable to
                        you in the aggregate (for all potential claims by you) for any damages incurred in excess of one
                        hundred dollars ($100). Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the
                        limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or
                        jurisdictions, our liability shall be limited to the extent permitted by law.</p>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Indemnification</strong>. You are solely legally liable if your use or misuse of the
                    Application, any associated content, or any products and/or services delivered to you through the
                    site causes damage to the Application, to you, or to someone or something else. You agree to defend,
                    indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates, licensors and service providers, and our respective
                    employees, contractors, officers, directors and agents from and against all liabilities, claims,
                    damages, judgment, awards, losses, costs, expenses, fines or fees (including attorney's fees and
                    investigation costs), that arise from or relate to your use or misuse of the Application, or
                    violation of these Terms or violation of a third party’s rights. We reserve the right, at our own
                    expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to
                    indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available
                    defenses.
                </li>

                    discretion by posting a revised version in the Application. Changes will not apply retroactively and

                    or (ii) thirty days after they are posted (whichever is sooner). However, changes addressing new
                    functions for the Application or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. We
                    will also update the Last Modified Date at the top of these Terms accordingly. Your continued use of
                    the Application after the Last Modified Date signifies your knowledge about and consent to the
                    modified Terms. You are expected to check this page frequently so you are aware of any changes, as
                    they are binding on you. If the modified Terms are not acceptable to you, you should not access or
                    use the Application after the Last Modified Date. We shall not be liable to you or to any third
                    party for any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service.

                        Terms or for business reasons. We also reserve the right to pursue any additional remedies
                        available in law or equity.</p>

                        otherwise restrict your access to the Application. We have no obligation to maintain, store, or
                        transfer your information or data that you have posted on or uploaded to the Application.</p>

                    U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions. If any portion of these terms is held to be
                    invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. In the event
                    of a conflict between a translated version of these terms and the English language version, the
                    English language version shall control.

                    rules and guidelines posted on the Application constitute the entire agreement between you and us.
                    If any part of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed in a
                    manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of
                    the parties, and the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. The paragraph
                    headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit any portion of these
                    Terms of Service.

                    acquirer of our business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. Any purported assignment in
                    violation of this section shall be void. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
                    relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your use of the Application.
                    Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such
                    right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.
